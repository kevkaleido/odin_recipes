Odin Recipes is a project that will demonstrate my proficiency in HTML and Git. Upon completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- Familiarity with HTML, including structuring content and styling
- Proficiency in using Git for version control, including committing, pushing, and managing changes
- Ability to build the basics of a website, including layout, navigation, and content organization

This project serves as a foundation for future web development projects, solidifying my understanding of HTML and Git. As I continue to build and expand Odin Recipes, I will further develop my skills in web development and version control.
