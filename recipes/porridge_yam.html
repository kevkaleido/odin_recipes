    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
        <li> African Yam</li>
          <li>Vegetables/Herbs: perfect the meal with herbs like basil, parsley, scent leaves, and any other leafy vegetables like spinach, kale, or fluted pumpkin leaf (Ugwu).</li>
         <li>Fish and crayfish: add this to spice up the meal. You can add mackerel, crab meat, stockfish, or dried fish. 
        </li>
          <li>Salt and Chicken bouillon powder: This will bring out the taste of the porridge. Ensure that you add in moderate quantity.
        </li>
          <li>Red Bell Pepper, tomato, and habanero pepper: the blend of these three will make a perfect pepper mix for the porridge. 
        </li>
          <li>Onion: Onions bring the flavor out of the porridge. You need onions for the pepper mix and the porridge itself</li>
          <li>2 red scotch bonnets</li>
          <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
          <li>Fresh Palm Oil</li>
          
       </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Peel and cut and rinse the yam. Ensure that you rinse the yam more than once until the water is clear and no longer cloudy. The yam should be in medium-sized chunks about 2 inches thick</li>
        <li>Blend your pepper mix. Blend the bell pepper, habanero, tomato, and half onion.</li>
        <li> Cook the yam and the pepper mix together. Put the first yams inside a pot, and add the pepper mix, salt, bouillon powder, and water. Cover and let it cook for 10 minutes on medium to high heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Palm oil, sliced onions, and crayfish. Cover again and let it cook extra 10 minutes</li>
        <li> Mash the yams. You can use a potato masher or a wooden spoon. I love to mash some yams and keep some chunks. It gives more texture!</li>
        <li>Add the fish. You can smoke fish, dried, boiled, canned, or stockfish. You can also add smoked turkey or any other meat you prefer.</li>
        <li> Simmer for an additional 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> Stir in the herbs or any other leafy vegetable of your choice.</li>
        <li> Serve and enjoy while still hot!</li>
        </ol>
